# Software-Project : K-Means Clustering
K-Means Clustering for Machine Learning, TAU University, 4th semester.

The software project course revolved around four projects using C and Python, primarily focusing on implementing the k-means algorithm.

**Assignment_0** - Introduction to C through a Base Converter project.

**Assignment_1** - The assignment tackled implementing the K-means algorithm, which clusters N observations into K distinct groups. It was executed in Python and C.
K-means involves iteratively assigning data points to clusters by their proximity to centroids and updating centroids to minimize intra-cluster variance.

**Assignment_2** - The assignment involved two main parts: first, implementing the K-means++ algorithm in Python to establish initial centroids for K-means.
Second, integrating this Python implementation with a previously created K-means algorithm in C using the C API. 

**Project** - The project involved implementing a clustering algorithm using symmetric Non-negative Matrix Factorization (symNMF).
